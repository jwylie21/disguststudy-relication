# Disgust Study Replication Pilot
This repo contains the script and stimuli necessary to run a behavioral study replication pilot of Sherman & Clore 2012 online

The file labeled index.html is the task file - small changes will need to be made if running a version of this experiment on cognition.run or elsewhere. 

Please email me at jwylie@gradcenter.cuny.edu with any questions or issues. 

You can test the experiment here: https://jwylie21.github.io/disguststudy-replication/
