          '<div align="left"><p>Let me tell you a little about what we did today. In this lab we are interested in how our motivations influence behavior and mental effort, particularly those related to our emotions or our values.<p>' + 
          "Previous research has shown morals influence a number of behavioral tasks. For example, research has shown that moral concerns can influence awareness of ambiguously presented stimuli and that moral words 'pop-out' in quick naming tasks compared to non-moral words (Gantman & Van Bavel, 2013). " + 
          " Other work has shown that moral values influence how polarizing an individual finds a specific issue (Garrett & Bankert, 2018). We believe that the ways that issues become moral issues is an important step to understanding how and why they influence the brain and behavior. Specifically, we believe that issue group affiliation and issue consensus are two ways that moralized issues may impact behavior. " + 
          " If an issue is seen to be highly moralized, nuanced opinions or strategies that allow for any of the action are not upheld by opposers (Wolsko, Ariceaga, & Seiden, 2016)." + 
          " Another important part of this research looks at how moral ideas, like the traditional American values of Protestantism and Puritanism still play a big role in how people decide between different consumer products, and judge others. America was founded by Puritan Protestants, who intended to create an inherently spiritual nation, envisioning it as a land of purity and spiritually righteous people. " + 
          " In fact, from the time of the first New England colonies, the ideologies of both the Protestant Work Ethic (views on work and salvation articulated by John Calvin) and Puritanism (the pursuit of piety through sexual and mental purity) have been forefront in the minds of Americans. While not everyone consciously endorses these beliefs today, we believe that Protestantism and Puritanism still play a big role in people’s intuitive judgments. " + 
          " In the studies we are now carrying out, we subtly prime Protestant or Puritan ideas and show that these subtly influence people. As part of the present study, you completed a sentence unscrambling task in which you were primed with either words related to salvation (divine, heaven) or neutral control words. We are hypothesizing that American students primed with salvation will work harder on the anagram task that comes right afterward (in comparison to people in the neutral-words control condition). " + 
          " This would be another manifestation of implicit Protestantism and Puritanism-- an unconscious link between hard work and divine salvation. " + 
          " During the course of the task, we tried to make sure you weren’t thinking about morals specifically. Instead, we framed the tasks in relation to general social issues. If you were told to to explicitly use your own values and morals to complete the task, you might have completed the task differently than you would normally. This is the reason we don’t explicitly tell you beforehand. Your performance on the tasks in no way is related to your character. " + 
          " Instead, these tasks are designed to test the hypothesis that specific characteristics of morals drive different intuitions about what is right and wrong to do in response. This means that even when you aren’t specifically trying to think about morally-related things, they jump out to you and grab your attention, and they drive how you decide to judge an instance or to act. The goal of the current study was to examine whether understanding what makes a moral “moralized” can help us define some of the conflict between differing opinions. " + 
          " Moreover do interactions between morals and cognition depend on individual differences or on something more human evolution-related, like brain lateralities? For instance, research has shown that cognitive control is influenced selectively by approach-withdrawal states based on hemispheric congruence (or incongruence) with both being enhanced by brain activity in the left prefrontal cortex (Gray 2001; Gray & Baver 2002). Does this map onto morals in a similar way? Moreover, do morals have adaptive functions that promote specific cognitive processes, while inhibiting other processes. This would suggest that our morals bias processing of incoming information." + 
          " Other parts of the experiment consisted of you filling out questionnaires.  These questionnaires provide us with information concerning your ideological background, mood state, political affiliation, individual values and your personality type.  These data will be used to see if any of these individual difference factors may be more or less likely to influence the tasks." + 
          "<p> All of your responses in this experiment are completely anonymous— it is impossible to link your name to your questionnaire responses.</p>" + 
          "In conclusion, your participation will help us understand processes involved in the use of mental resources when people are engaged in reasoning surrounding moral issues.
